The perfect keyboard setup

<b>64 > 104</b>
<br>I love this keyboard. It only has 64 keys. But there are still many keys on the keyboard that I never use. So I redefined those keys to improve my workflow. 
<br>
<br>Take "caps-lock" for instance, it is a completely useless key taking up a great spot on the keyboard. So what I did was redefine left-shift + right-shift to be caps-lock, and the caps-lock key is defined as Escape, which I use very frequently in vim. 
<br>
<br>The "menu" key, I use for switching between workspaces, and "space-3" (I think that is its proper name) is redefined to λ. Why λ? Well, one keypress is better than two, so instead of having to press "ctrl-b" when using tmux, I just set my prefix key to λ. Efficiency doubled!

<b>xev</b>
<br>In order to redefine keys, we first need to find their values. The easiest way is to use xev. Run xev and then remember the keycode. In order to simplify the process, you could pipe it through awk like this: 
<br><code>xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'</code>
<br><br>
<b>xmodmap</b>
<br>
<br>
The next step is redefining the keys. I recommend making a configuration file and then starting it with X.
<br><code>!keybindings.conf<br>
	keycode 171 = Greek_LAMDA
	keycode 135 = backslash
</code><br>
Then load the configuration file with <code>xmodmap keybindings.conf</code>
